# Monster Tracker!

This is a Gloomhaven monster tracker app that started as a pet project for my
own gaming group who has been playing Gloomhaven for about a year now.

It is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), the frontend framework I am
most familiar with.

## Features

- Tracks health (hit points) in a downward motion, using +/- buttons.
- Can track conditions (muddled, strengthened)
- Monsters that are not long for this world get a glowing health bar.

## Conspicuous in Their Absence

- There is no round tracking or automatic removal of conditions
- There is no calculation of "hits" against conditions. Do that yourself!
